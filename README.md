# Clock-in
Created a clock-in system using python only.
This program allow employees (users) to clock in and out using their username and password. The program records their working hours and breaks time, and a report can be generated at admin request where every detail would be displayed in a table format. An excel file is generated every day as a backup. This program allows admin to add new employees (users) to the program. When admin adds an employee(user), Clock-in system creates a notepad file with their personal details. The program will not stop functioning without admin's permission.
